# Tokyo Olympics Data Processing with Azure Data Factory and Databricks
### üìë Project Overview
This project utilizes Tokyo Olympics data to demonstrate a scalable data engineering workflow. 
By leveraging Azure Data Factory for data orchestration and Azure Databricks for data transformation and analytics, this pipeline processes, analyzes, and visualizes Olympic data.
The entire project is integrated into a GitHub repository for collaboration and version control.

### üöÄ Features
- **Data Orchestration:** Automated workflows using Azure Data Factory.
- **Data Transformation:** Processed raw CSV data into structured formats using PySpark in Azure Databricks.
- **Cloud Integration:** Seamless data movement between Azure Blob Storage and Databricks.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Built to handle large-scale datasets.
- **Version Control:** All scripts and workflows are managed using GitHub.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies
- **Azure Data Factory:** For scheduling and orchestrating data workflows.
- **Azure Databricks:** For data processing and analytics using PySpark.
- **Azure Blob Storage:** For storing raw and processed data.
- **Spark:** For scalable data transformations and computations.
- **GitHub:** For version control and project collaboration.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions
**Prerequisites:**
- Azure subscription with access to Data Factory and Databricks.
- Git installed for version control.
- Azure Setup: Upload the raw Tokyo Olympics data to Azure Blob Storage.
Import the provided Azure Data Factory pipeline JSONs into your Azure portal.
Configure the necessary connections (Blob Storage, Databricks, etc.) in Data Factory.
- Run the Workflow: Trigger the pipeline in Azure Data Factory to load data into Databricks.
Use the provided notebook (Tokyo-OlympicData-Azure.ipynb) to process and analyze the data in Databricks.

### üîó Connecting Azure and GitHub
Follow these steps to establish a connection between Azure and GitHub for version control, CI/CD, and workflow automation:

- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD:

- Navigate to Deployment Center in Azure.
Select GitHub as the source control, authenticate your account, and choose the repository.
Azure auto-generates a GitHub Actions workflow file for automated deployments.

- Add GitHub Secrets:
Add the following secrets in your GitHub repository under Settings > Secrets and Variables:
1. AZURE_CLIENT_ID
2. AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET
3. AZURE_TENANT_ID
4. AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
- Configure GitHub Actions Workflow
- Integrate Azure Data Factory with GitHub

In Azure Data Factory, go to Manage > Git Configuration.
Choose GitHub as the repository type and set up the collaboration and working branches.
- Push Data from Azure to GitHub
- Monitor Pipelines:
Use GitHub Actions for deployment logs.
- Monitor Azure resource health with Azure Monitor.

### üìä Results
The project successfully processes Tokyo Olympics data into clean, structured formats for analysis.
Insights into athlete performance, medal distributions, and country rankings can be visualized through Spark analytics.
